Start: Enter both player names. Names must contain alphanumeric characters and 
	be fewer than 15 characters in length.
Moves: By default, player one will make the first move. In the event of a tie,
	the player who did not make the first move that round will make the first 
	move of the next round. If a player wins the round, the player who did 
	not make the first move of that round will make the first move of the 
	next round.
Symbols: Player one is represented by the X. Player two is represented by the O.
Input: Players can control the game via the numberpad or through mouse clicks.
Mouse: Click in the individual cell which you wish to claim as your own, assuming 
	the cell is not already claimed.
Keyboard: Key 7 represents the top left cell, 8 is the top middle, 9 is top right, 
	4 is center left, 5 is center middle, 6 is center right, 
	1 is bottom left, 2 is bottom middle, and 3 is bottom right.
Scores: At the top of the application, player scores are shown. The currently active 
	player is indicated by the rectangle border surrounding the player.
File menu: From the file menu, players can restart the game or exit the game.
Game restart: Restarting the game will prompt players to assign new names.
Exit: Exiting the game will close the application entirely.
Edit menu: From the edit menu, players can undo their most recent move, assuming it 
	wasn't a game-ending move.
Help menu: Players can view the about screen, which indicates the application, 
	build number, and the game team's names.
Game end: Once a game has ended, players will be prompted asking if they wish to play 
	again. Should they select no, the game will exit. If yes, it will ask them 
	if they wish to change names.
Changing names: When the change name screen comes up, players must enter two different
	names not being actively used. Both names must be different for names to 
	change. Names still must contain alphanumeric keys and be fewer than 15 
	characters in length. When inappropriate names or lack of names are input, 
	they will be presented a frame explaining what needs to be changed.
Scores: When players are tied, player names and their scores will be colored orange.
	When one player has a higher score than the other, they will be colored 
	in green. The losing player will be colored red.
